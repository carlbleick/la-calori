## What is going on?

Join **TACO GATO** on its space adventure collecting ingredients, serving tacos and dodging asteroids.

Reach new highscores by completing as many orders as possible before the timer runs out.

Each taco is carefully prepared from taco shells, sliced veggies and cooked protein :)
